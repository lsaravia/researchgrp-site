abstract: $<$h2$>$Summary$<$/h2$><$p$>$Between 2019 and 2020, during the country's
  hottest and driest year on record, Australia experienced a dramatic bushfire season,
  with catastrophic ecological and environmental consequences. Several studies highlighted
  how such abrupt changes in fire regimes may have been in large part a consequence
  of climate change and other anthropogenic transformations. Here, we analyze the
  monthly evolution of the burned area in Australia from 2000 to 2020, obtained via
  satellite imaging through the MODIS platform. We find that the 2019--2020 peak is
  associated with signatures typically found near critical points. We introduce a
  modeling framework based on forest-fire models to study the properties of these
  emergent fire outbreaks, showing that the behavior observed during the 2019--2020
  fire season matches the one of a percolation transition, where system-size outbreaks
  appear. Our model also highlights the existence of an absorbing phase transition
  that might be eventually crossed, after which the vegetation cannot recover.$<$/p$>$
