abstract: Most coastal glaciers on the West Antarctic Peninsula are in retreat. Glacial
  ice scouring and lithogenic particle runoff increase turbidity and shape soft sediment
  benthic communities. This, in turn, has the potential to induce a shift in these
  systems from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic state. In this study, we investigated
  the influence of glacial runoff on carbon flows in the soft-sediment food web of
  Potter Cove, a well-studied shallow fjord located in the northern region of the
  West Antarctic Peninsula. We constructed linear inverse food web models using a
  dataset that includes benthic carbon stocks as well as carbon production and respiration
  rates. The dataset offers detailed spatial information across three locations and
  seasonal variations spanning three seasons, reflecting different degrees of disturbance
  from glacial melt runoff. In these highly resolved food web models, we quantified
  the carbon flows from various resource compartments (phytoplankton detritus, macroalgae,
  microphytobenthos, sediment detritus) to consumers (ranging from prokaryotes to
  various functional groups in meio-and macrofauna). Locations and seasons characterized
  by high glacial melt runoff exhibited distinct patterns of carbon flow compared
  to those with low glacial melt runoff. This difference was primarily driven by a
  less pronounced benthic primary production pathway, an impaired microbial loop and
  a lower secondary production of the dominant bivalve Aequiyoldia eightsii and other
  infauna. In contrast, the bivalve Laternula elliptica and meiofauna had the highest
  secondary production close to the glacier, where they are exposed to high glacial
  melt runoff. This study shows how the effects of glacial melt propagate from lower
  to higher trophic levels, thereby affecting the transfer of energy in the ecosystem.
