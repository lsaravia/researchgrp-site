abstract: 'Demersal fisheries are one of the top anthropic stressors in marine environments.
  In the long term, some species are more vulnerable to fishery impacts than others,
  which can lead to permanent changes on the food web. The trophic relationships between
  predator and prey constitute the food web and it represents a network of the energy
  channels in an ecosystem. In turn, the network structure influences ecosystem diversity
  and stability. The first aim of this study was to describe for the first time the
  food web of the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia Argentina) with high resolution, i.e.~to
  the species level when information is available. The San Jorge Gulf was subject
  to intense fisheries thus our second aim is to analyse the food web structure with
  and without fishery to evaluate if the bottom-trawl industrial fishery altered the
  network structure and stability. We used several network metrics like: mean trophic
  level, omnivory, modularity and quasi-sign stability. We included these metrics
  because they are related to stability and can be evaluated using predator diets
  that can weight the links between predators and prey. The network presented 165
  species organized in almost five trophic levels. The inclusion of a fishery node
  adds 69 new trophic links. All weighted and unweighted metrics showed differences
  between the two networks, reflecting a decrease in stability when fishery was included
  in the system. Thus, our results suggested a probable change of state of the system.
  The observed changes in species abundances since the fishery was established, could
  represent the state change predicted by network analysis. Our results suggests that
  changes in the stability of food webs can be used to evaluate the impacts of human
  activity on ecosystems.'
