abstract: 'Multifractals have been applied to characterize complex communities in
  a spatial context. They were developed for nonlinear systems and are particularly
  suited to capture multiplicative processes observed in ecological systems. Multifractals
  characterize variability in a scale-independent way within an experimental range.
  I have developed an open-source software package to estimate multifractals using
  a box-counting algorithm (available from https://github.com/lsaravia/mfsba and permanently
  available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.8481). The software is specially designed for two
  dimensional (2D) images such as the ones obtained from remote sensing, but other
  2D data types can also be analyzed. Additionally I developed a new metric to analyze
  multispecies spatial patterns with multifractals: spatial rank surface, which is
  included in the software.'
