abstract: The short-term biomass dynamics of periphyton communities in running water
  is characterized by deep variations. This temporal variability is mainly produced
  by changes in running water velocity. The shear force caused by the friction of
  water over the surface of the periphyton produces a removal of biomass and creates
  open sites for colonization. Running water also brings new suspended algae that
  can establish on open sites. An increase in the velocity of the water can also improve
  the renewal of nutrients in depleted areas and the elimination of waste products,
  producing higher reproductive rates. In this paper, we have developed a model of
  periphyton biomass dynamics taking the water velocity and nutrient concentration
  as external driving variables influencing immigration, removal and reproductive
  rate of the algae. We fitted the model to field data encompassing high and low water
  velocities and different seasons. We have qualitatively compared the parameters
  obtained from different situations with the expected ones based on bibliographic
  information. The model has shown a good fit to field data and parameters were similar
  to expected ones, giving evidence that the model provides a good description for
  the processes that dominate the periphyton dynamics in running waters. (C) 1998
