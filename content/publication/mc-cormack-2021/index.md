abstract: Globally important services are supported by Southern Ocean ecosystems,
  underpinned by the structure, function, and dynamics of complex interconnected and
  regionally distinctive food webs. These food webs vary in response to a combination
  of physical and chemical processes that alter productivity, species composition
  and the relative abundance and dynamics of organisms. Combined with regional and
  seasonal variability, climate-induced changes and human activities have and are
  expected to continue to drive important structural and functional changes to Southern
  Ocean food webs. However, our current understanding of food web structure, function,
  status, and trends is patchy in space and time, and methods for systematically assessing
  and comparing community-level responses to change within and across regional and
  temporal scales are not well developed. Insights gained from food web modelling
  studies---ranging from theoretical analyses of ecosystem resilience and adaptation,
  to qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the system---can assist in resolving
  patterns of energy flow and the ecological mechanisms that drive food web structure,
  function, and responses to drivers (such as fishing and climate change). This understanding
  is required to inform robust management strategies to conserve Southern Ocean food
  webs and the ecosystem services they underpin in the face of change. This paper
  synthesises the current state of knowledge regarding Southern Ocean pelagic food
  webs, highlighting the distinct regional food web characteristics, including key
  drivers of energy flow, dominant species, and network properties that may indicate
  system resilience. In particular, the insights, gaps, and potential integration
  of existing knowledge and Southern Ocean food web models are evaluated as a basis
  for developing integrated food web assessments that can be used to test the efficacy
  of alternative management and policy options. We discuss key limitations of existing
  models for assessing change resulting from various drivers, summarise priorities
  for model development and identify that significant progress could be made to support
  policy by advancing the development of food web models coupled to projected biogeochemical
  models, such as in Earth System models.
