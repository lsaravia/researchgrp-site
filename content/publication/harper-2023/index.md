abstract: "Ecosystems experiencing pressures are at risk of rapidly transitioning
  (`tipping') from one state to another. Identifying and managing these so-called
  tipping points continues to be a challenge in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial
  ecosystems, particularly when multiple potentially interacting drivers are present.
  Knowledge of tipping points, the mechanisms that cause them, and their implications
  for management practices are evolving, but often in isolation within specific ecological
  realms. Here we summarize current knowledge of tipping points in marine, freshwater,
  and terrestrial realms, and provide a multi-realm perspective of the challenges
  and opportunities for applying this knowledge to ecosystem management. We brought
  together conservation practitioners and global experts in marine, freshwater, and
  terrestrial tipping points and identified seven challenges that environmental policymakers
  and managers contend with including: 1) predictability, 2) spatiotemporal scales,
  3) interactions, 4) reversibility, 5) socio-ecological context, 6) complexity and
  heterogeneity, and 7) selecting appropriate action. We highlight opportunities for
  cross-scalar and cross-realm knowledge production and provide recommendations for
  enabling management of tipping points. Although knowledge of tipping points is imperfect,
  we stress the need to continue working towards incorporating tipping points perspectives
  in environmental management across all realms."
