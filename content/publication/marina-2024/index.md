abstract: Network approaches can shed light on the structure and stability of complex
  marine communities. In recent years, such approaches have been successfully applied
  to study polar ecosystems, improving our knowledge on how they might respond to
  ongoing environmental changes. The Weddell Sea is one of the most studied marine
  ecosystems outside the Antarctic Peninsula in the Southern Ocean. Yet, few studies
  consider the known complexity of the Weddell Sea food web, which in its current
  form comprises 490 species and 16 041 predator--prey interactions. Here we analysed
  the Weddell Sea food web, focusing on the species and trophic interactions that
  underpin ecosystem structure and stability. We estimated the strength for each interaction
  in the food web, characterised species position in the food web using unweighted
  and weighted food web properties, and analysed species' roles with respect to the
  stability of the food web. We found that the distribution of the interaction strength
  (IS) at the food web level is asymmetric, with many weak interactions and few strong
  ones. We detected a positive relationship between species median IS and two unweighted
  properties (i.e. trophic level and the total number of interactions). We also found
  that only a few species possess key positions in terms of food web stability. These
  species are characterised by high median IS, a middle to high trophic level, a relatively
  high number of interactions, and middle to low trophic similarity. In this study,
  we integrated unweighted and weighted food web information, enabling a more complete
  assessment of the ecosystem structure and function of the Weddell Sea food web.
  Our results provide new insights, which are important for the development of effective
  policies and management strategies, particularly given the ongoing initiative to
  implement a marine protected area (MPA) in the Weddell Sea.
