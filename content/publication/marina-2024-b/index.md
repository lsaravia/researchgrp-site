abstract: 'Ecological networks offer valuable insights into community structure, key
  species identification, and ecosystem management. Understanding how these networks
  respond to global change stressors is of increasing interest, especially along geographical
  gradients. This review summarizes potential stressor responses in marine food webs
  from the Southwest Atlantic to the Antarctic (45 - 78$^∘$S), encompassing areas
  such as San Jorge Gulf, Beagle Channel, Burdwood Bank, Scotia Sea, Potter Cove,
  and the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. The objectives are: 1) to describe the structure
  of marine food webs along this latitudinal axis using a network approach; 2) to
  identify predominant global change-related stressors affecting each ecosystem; and
  3) to summarize observed food web changes and hypothesize on stressor impacts. The
  effects of stressors were primarily reviewed at the species level. Alternative hypotheses
  for each study area were formulated considering: a) main stressors; b) impacted
  parameters; c) node-level species properties; and d) network-level food web properties.
  Global warming emerges as the most common stressor among the studied areas across
  the latitudinal gradient, except in the Beagle Channel and Burdwood Bank, where
  alien species introduction and fisheries are more influential. We offer a series
  of alternative hypotheses on how warming may affect the food webs. This review emphasizes
  the benefits of using a network approach to understand and predict stressor effects
  in Southern Hemisphere marine ecosystems. This approach provides a holistic understanding
  of ecosystems, which enhances our ability to identify key species and their interactions,
  offering insights for ecosystem management and conservation in the face of global
  change stressors.'
