abstract: "Food web structure plays an important role in determining ecosystem stability against perturbations. High-latitude marine ecosystems are being affected by environmental stressors and biological invasions. In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations."
