abstract: Food web structure plays an important role in determining ecosystem stability
  against perturbations. High-latitude marine ecosystems are being affected by environmental
  stressors and biological invasions. In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations
  are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic
  activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor
  the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared
  the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle
  Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey)
  and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs
  presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The
  Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss
  of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity
  and greater stability against perturbations.
