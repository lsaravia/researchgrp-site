abstract: "1. Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions
  by species from the regional pool or metaweb, i.e., the assembly process. Assembly
  is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network
  structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat
  filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should
  reflect these processes. 2. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these
  selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to
  the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in
  ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical
  stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate
  from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 3. To create a null expectation,
  we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species
  and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation
  and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had
  no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used:
  (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the
  Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys' classic defaunation
  experiment. 4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no
  differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model.
  Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties,
  motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with
  stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory.
  5. Our results suggest that --- for the commonly used metrics we considered ---
  local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions.
  Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network
  properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability
  are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially
  be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint."
