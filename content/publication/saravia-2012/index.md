abstract: We analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and spatial biomass heterogeneity
  along an ecological succession developed in the laboratory. Periphyton (attached
  microalgae) biomass spatial patterns at several successional stages were obtained
  using digital image analysis and at the same time we estimated the species composition
  and abundance. We show that the spatial pattern was self-similar and as the community
  developed in an homogeneous environment the pattern is self-organized. To characterize
  it we estimated the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimensions Dq. Using Dq
  we analyze the existence of cycles of heterogeneity during succession and the use
  of the information dimension D1 as an index of successional stage. We did not find
  cycles but the values of D1 showed an increasing trend as the succession developed
  and the biomass was higher. D1 was also negatively correlated with Shannon's diversity.
  Several studies have found this relationship in different ecosystems but here we
  prove that the community self-organizes and generates its own spatial heterogeneity
  influencing diversity. If this is confirmed with more experimental and theoretical
  evidence D1 could be used as an index, easily calculated from remote sensing data,
  to detect high or low diversity areas.
