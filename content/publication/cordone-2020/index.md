abstract: 'Food web analyses are powerful tools to understand the structure, dynamics
  and stability of communities. Potter Cove (25 de Mayo/King George Island) is one
  of the most biodiverse and studied fjords on the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP),
  where climate change is affecting benthic and pelagic communities. This fjord ecosystem
  presents a considerable degree of environmental and species distribution heterogeneity
  across space: the outer portion of the cove is dominated by hard bottoms meanwhile
  the inner portion is dominated by soft bottoms. In this work, we have incorporated
  habitat type to a highly-resolved Antarctic food web, and evaluated its effects
  on different network metrics and proxies for various dimensions of stability. We
  considered a multidimensional perspective and employed simulation techniques to
  encompass variability. Our results showed that the incorporation of habitat type
  to Potter Cove food web analysis led to two different functional types of networks
  segregated on space: a green food web (in the outer cove) and a brown food web (in
  the inner cove). The green and the brown food webs showed significant differences
  in network structure and in some proxies for multidimensional stability (i.e. quasi
  sign-stability and omnivory), suggesting that these two food webs have different
  resilience to perturbations. However, there were no changes in network robustness
  when in silico experiments were performed. We conclude that habitat type plays a
  significant role in the structure and stability of Antarctic food webs, and should
  be taken into account to design effective conservation strategies.'
