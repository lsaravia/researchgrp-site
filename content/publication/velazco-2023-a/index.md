abstract: Soil-dwelling organisms populate the spaces---referred to as interstices---between
  the litter on the soil surface and the pores in the soil's organo-mineral matrix.
  These organisms have pivotal roles in soil ecosystem functions, such as the breakdown
  and decomposition of organic matter, the dispersal of bacterial and fungal spores
  and biological habitat transformation. These functions, in turn, contribute to broader
  ecosystem services like carbon and nutrient cycling, soil organic matter regulation
  and both chemical and physical soil fertility.This study provides morphological
  data pertaining to a range of soil organism sizes, specifically in Argiudol soils
  subjected to varying levels of agricultural activity in the Rolling Pampas Region,
  one of the world's most extensive and fertile plains.The primary focus is on soil
  microarthropods---namely, Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails)---with a body
  width of less than 2 mm. These organisms constitute the majority of life in the
  intricate soil pore network. Additionally, the study documents species of earthworms
  (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitelata), recognised as ecosystem engineers for their ability
  to create physical channels in the soil matrix and to distribute organic matter.
  Moreover, the study includes measurements of morphological traits of soil-dwelling
  \"macrofauna\" (organisms with a body width greater than 2 mm), which are also implicated
  in various soil ecosystem functions. These include population regulation by apex
  predators, organic matter decomposition, biogenic structure formation, nutrient
  mobilisation and herbivory.In this paper, we report both the geographical locations
  and individual measurements of key morphological traits for over 7,000 specimens,
  covering a range of soil-dwelling organisms. These include springtails (Entognatha,
  Collembola), mites (Arachnida, Acari), earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitellata)
  and additional soil macrofauna. All specimens were collected from typical Argiudol
  soils located in three distinct agricultural systems characterised by varying levels
  of land-use intensity. To our knowledge, no other dataset exists providing this
  information for the Argentinian Pampas.
