The Antarctic rocky coasts are mainly colonized by extensive macroalgal
communities, which play key roles as food resource, habitat and refuge for many benthic and
pelagic organisms. Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being affected
by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g. newly ice-free areas that can be colonized by
macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of macroalgae are changing in
these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the carbon production, especially from
large brown algae, is an important food source to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly
when other resources are scarce. Thus, in new areas colonized by macroalgae, the trophic
structure and biogeochemical fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water movement, ice scouring or storms, they are detached, fragmented and
degraded, incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal
food webs, i.e. they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the benthos. The
present chapter is a review of the knowledge of seaweed biomass and production in the
coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of these organisms as main
energy sources in e.g., small fjords and glacier influenced sites, impacted by recent climatic
change.
