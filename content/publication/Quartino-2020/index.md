abstract: The Antarctic rocky coasts are mainly colonized by extensive seaweed communities,
  which play key roles as food resource, habitat, and refuge for many benthic and
  pelagic organisms. Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being
  affected by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g., newly ice-free areas that
  can be colonized by macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of
  macroalgae are changing in these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the
  carbon production, especially from large brown algae, is an important food source
  to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly when other resources are scarce.
  Thus, in new areas colonized by seaweeds, the trophic structure and biogeochemical
  fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water
  movement, ice scouring, or storms, they are detached, fragmented, and degraded,
  incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal
  food webs, i.e., they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the
  benthos. The present chapter is a review of the knowledge on seaweed biomass and
  production in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of
  these organisms as main energy sources in, e.g., small fjords and glacier-influenced
  sites, impacted by recent climatic change.
