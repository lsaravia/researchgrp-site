abstract: 'Spatially explicit models like cellular automata are widely used in ecology.
  The spatio-temporal order of events is a new feature of these models that does not
  have to be considered in equivalent non-spatial models. We considered simple stochastic
  cellular automata to test sensitivity of model response under different spatial
  and temporal sequences of events. The results indicate that very important differences
  in model output can be found as spatio-temporal ordering is changed, even in a very
  simple model. A careful choice of the way events are evaluated has to be made: the
  spatio-temporal ordering must be selected to match the biological characteristics
  of the target ecological system to be modelled. Further, a complete description
  of the details of this ordering should be specified in order to let others reproduce
  published simulation experiments.'
