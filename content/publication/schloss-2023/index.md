abstract: The Beagle Channel at the southernmost tip of South America is an interoceanic
  passage connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. It is characterized by intricate
  coastlines and changing bathymetry, a dominant West to East circulation pattern,
  and a strong longitudinal gradient of glacial fresh-water discharge. Harmful algal
  blooms (HAB) and toxic outbreaks have been detected along the channel for the last
  two decades and monitored by both Chilean and Argentinean agencies. This unique
  scenario was used to try to answer whether HABs propagate from West to East along
  the channel following the main water flow, so that a sequential, spatial pattern
  can be identified, or if local dynamics due to particular hydrographic characteristics
  might favor HAB formation in different areas along the channel. For this analysis,
  we selected data from three austral spring-summer seasons, 2009--2010, 2010--2011,
  and 2012--2013, when by means of the mouse bioassay important concentrations of
  saxitoxins (STX) derivatives were detected in shellfish from different stations
  along the channel. Relevant information on hydrographical (temperature, salinity,
  bathymetry, main currents), chemical (macronutrients), and biological (cell abundance
  of the main species responsible for the toxic outbreaks in the channel, i.e. Alexandrium
  catenella) characteristics are analyzed. Results show that during the years when
  toxicity was highest, there was no evidence of West to East (longitudinal) transport
  of toxins along the channel. Contrastingly, smaller-scale patterns could explain
  the observed dynamics associated with three sub-basins previously described for
  the Beagle Channel, identified as western, central, and eastern regions. We built
  a conceptual model based on own and published data on bathymetry, PAR, salinity,
  water residence time, silicate availability, and DOM to understand the differences
  in HAB presence among the sub-basins, which allows explaining the higher toxicity
  values registered in the central part of the channel as compared to the western
  or easternmost regions.
