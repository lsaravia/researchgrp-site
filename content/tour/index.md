      - title: Ecología y Sistemas Complejos
        content: The Ecological Complex Systems Lab investigates how ecological systems are shaped by interactions across scales—spatial, temporal, and organizational—using complex systems theory, quantitative modeling, and network approaches.

      - title: Ecosystems Under Pressure From the Amazon to Antarctica
        content: Our research spans ecosystems from the Amazon basin to the Southern Ocean, addressing pressing questions about biodiversity loss, food web stability, climate change, fragmentation, and disturbance regimes such as wildfires.

      - title: Modeling Interaction Networks Under Global Change
        content: We develop and apply tools grounded in network theory, spatial ecology, and stochastic modeling to explore how species interactions—both trophic and non-trophic—govern the resilience and functioning of ecosystems under anthropogenic stressors.
